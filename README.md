# English_LearningTool
An application for generating and conducting listening tests and text-based quizzes based on videos and uploaded text materials.
This project currently runs on Windows only.

## 🎯 Objective
Provide a simple, Windows-only tool to generate and run both listening tests (from videos) and text-based quizzes (from uploaded materials) through a Gradio web interface, using OpenAI for question generation and optional text-to-speech for audio playback.

## 📖 How to use
1. Clone this project
2. Set up OpenAI API Key  
   This project reads your OpenAI API key from a `.env` file located in the project root directory.
   1. Create a `.env` file in the project root (same directory as `app.py`).
   2. Add the following line to your `.env` file and paste your API key:
      ```dotenv
      OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
      ```
3. Install required packages in your Python environment (see `requirements.txt`).  
   If you use Anaconda to create a virtual environment, you only need to run the following command **inside that environment**:
   ```bash
   pip install python-dotenv openai pygame pydub yt-dlp gradio==5.44.1 git+https://github.com/openai/whisper.git
   ```
4. Run `app.py`
5. Choose a workflow in the Gradio UI:

   ### 🎧 Listening Test
   1. Extract transcripts using speech-to-text from a video (local file or YouTube) with Whisper.
   2. Generate listening questions from the transcript using the OpenAI Response API (you can decide how many questions to create).
   3. Use text-to-speech to read questions aloud during the listening test.
   4. Run the listening test in the Gradio UI.

   ### 📝 Text-Based Quiz
   1. Upload the materials to an OpenAI Vector Store for retrieval (File Search / RAG).
   2. Generate text-based quiz questions using the OpenAI Response API with retrieval from the Vector Store.
   3. Run the text-based quiz in the Gradio UI.
